# This is an example configuration file for the Unreal3.0-Morrican
# and higher IRC servers.
# 
# You only need an ircd.conf (IRC server configuration file) if you are
# running an IRC server. If you are running a standalone client this file
# is not necessary.
#
# This file will explain the various lines in the IRC server
# configuration file. Not all lines are mandatory. You can check to make
# sure that your configuration file is correct by using the program
# "chkconf", provided in the server distribution (and when you do "make
# install" this program will be installed in the same directory as the irc
# server). 
#
# This document modified for use by with the Unreal3.0 IRCD
#
#
# The options for whether a line is needed or not are: 
# MANDATORY: you absolutely MUST have this line
# NETWORKED: you must have this line if you are connecting this irc
#            server to any other server (servers can run standalone).
# SUGGESTED: it is highly suggested that you use this line
# OPTIONAL: it's completely up to you whether to define this or not
# DISCOURAGED: you really really should not use this line if at all
#              possible. 
# OBSOLETE: an old or out of date line that isn't needed.
#
# MANDATORY lines are absolute *musts*, that is, if you do not have this
# line then your server will not work properly. SUGGESTED lines are
# close-to-mandatory (that is, the server will run without it, but you are
# highly encouraged to use these lines).
#
# Note that "*" in a field indicates an "unused" field.
#
#
# ========================================================================
# NOTE! this entire configuration file is read UPSIDE-DOWN! So if you have
# to put something in a specific order (for example, client-connection
# lines), put them in reverse order!
# ========================================================================
#
#
# M: [MANDATORY]. This line sets your server's name, description, port
# number, and IP address to bind to. Fields, in order, are: 
#
# If you leave IP address field blank or
# *, it defaults to binding all local IP addresses on the machine.
#
# M:hostname:IP:Description Of Your Server:port:NS
#
# NS is a new feature in Unreal3.1. It is optional but it is recommended.
# Every server on the network must have a completely unique NS. This number
# will be used to identify the server.
#
M:server.my.net:*:My IRC Server:6667:34
#
# A: [MANDATORY]. This line lists your administrative information
# (contact address, etc). To view this information, /admin (server) will
# show it to you.
#
# The A: line has no set information, in fact, you can put arbitrary text
# in there if you wish (it is encouraged that you put at *least* a contact
# address for a person responsible for the irc server, however)
#
A:Generic Internet Access:Admin John Doe:jdoe@generic.com
#
# Y: [SUGGESTED]. These lines define connection classes. Connection
# classes allow you to fine-tune your client and server connections. It is
# suggested that clients and servers be placed in seperate classes, and if
# you have lots of server connections (if you do have lots of servers you
# shouldn't be reading this file :-) each set of servers (defined
# arbitrarily by you) should have its own class. If you have clients
# coming in from lots of different sites, you may want to seperate them
# out into classes. For instance, you may want to put local users in one
# class, with remote users in another class.
#
# The class numbers are not arbitrary. In auto-connecting servers -- that
# is, servers that you have a port number (e.g. 6667) on the end of the C:
# line (see below) the higher the number the higher the priority in
# auto-connecting.
#
# The fields in order are: class number, ping frequency (in seconds),
# connect frequency (in seconds), maximum number of links (used for
# auto-connecting, and for limiting the number of clients in that class),
# and sendq (this overrides any value set in include/config.h for #define
# MAXSENDQLENGTH).
#
# Note that it is a good idea to have ping frequency the same at both ends
# of the link.
# 
# in this case, connect-frequency is 0 indicating that this is a client
# class (servers never connect to clients, it is the other way around).
Y:1:90:0:20:100000
#
# These are the recommended server Y:lines for connecting to dalnet.
# In addition to these you should have at *least* one client class, and one
# oper class (see O:lines).  By convention on dalnet, these are usually
# numbered from 5 to 10.
#
# Class 50 - Hub to hub, autoconnect
Y:50:90:60:1:4000000
#
# Class 51 - Hub to hub, no autoconnect
Y:51:90:60:0:4000000
#
# Class 30 - Hub to US leaf
Y:30:90:0:0:3500000 
#
# Class 32 - Hub to EU leaf
Y:32:180:0:0:3500000
#
# Class 34 - Hub to AU leaf
Y:34:300:0:0:3500000
#
# Class 40 - US leaf to hub, autoconnect
Y:40:90:90:1:3500000
#
# Class 41 - US leaf to hub, no autoconnect
Y:41:90:90:0:3500000
#
# Class 42 - EU leaf hub
Y:42:180:90:1:3500000
#
# Class 44 - AU leaf to hub
Y:44:300:120:1:3500000
#
# I: [MANDATORY]. The I: lines are client-authorization lines. Without
# these lines, no clients will be able to connect to your server.
# Wildcards ("*") are permitted. Passwords are also permitted (clients can
# be configured to send passwords).
# 
# Ident (for more information on this, see rfc1413) can also be used by
# placing a @ in the appropriate fields.
#
# Fields are as follows:
# I:IP-address-mask:optional password:domain-mask::connection class (opt)
#
# With a password..... This will allow anyone from anywhere to connect
# as long as they know the password ("foobar"). Note listing this I: line
# first, it will be read *last*, meaning it is the "fall-through". That
# is, anyone who doesn't match the I: lines listed below must know the
# password ("foobar") to connect.
#
I:*@*:foobar:*@*::1
# This is a standard vanilla I: line which will permit anyone with an IP
# address starting with 205.133 OR with a hostname ending in 
# .toledolink.com to connect to the server. NOTE, the ircd matches on the 
# *right-most* match, so if I connect as rmiller@glass.toledolink.com 
# (which is rmiller@205.133.127.8) I will show up on irc as 
# rmiller@glass.toledolink.com since that is the first match it found. 
# (Even though the second match is valid). 
I:205.133.*::*.toledolink.com::1
# 
# using ident
I:*@205.133.*::*@*.toledolink.com::1
# and you can even specify just certain usernames running ident (as long
# as the client's site is running the ident daemon):
I:NOMATCH::rmiller@glass.toledolink.com::1
# putting NOMATCH in the first field will stop the ircd from matching
# automatically against the IP address and it will force the server to
# match against the hostname. (the "NOMATCH" string is not mandatory, you
# can use any arbitrary text in the first field).
I:*@*:ONE:*@*::1
# putting the ONE in the password field makes it so that only 1 user matching
# that host or IP can connect through that I:line.
# 
#
# O: [OPTIONAL]. These lines define operator access. You do not need to
# have an operator to run a server. A well configured leaf site should not
# need an operator online, if it's connections are well defined, the irc
# administrator can use kill -HUP on the ircd to reload the configuration
# file. 
# The fields are as follows:
# O:hostname (ident "@" permitted):password:NickName:AccessFlags:class
# if the person in "NickName" is not coming from the hostname defined in
# the first field then the person will get the error message "No O: lines
# for your host". 
# NOTE that since Crypted Passwords are defined by default in
# include/config.h this text probably will not be plaintext. See
# ircd/crypt/README for more information.
#
# class is the Y:Line class you want this operator to end up in after they
# have successfully /oper'd.
#
# Access flags may be left blank, or * to give full access rights. Flags
# are in the form of single characters making a string.  Any combination
# of the following can be used(these are cAsE sensitive characters):
#
# r = access to /rehash server
# R = access to /restart server
# D = access to /die server
# h = oper can send /help ops
# g = oper can send /globops
# w = oper can send /wallops
# l = oper can send /locops
# c = access to do local /squits and /connects
# L = access to do remote /squits and /connects
# k = access to do local /kills
# K = access to do global /kills
# b = oper can /kline users from server
# B = oper can /unkline users from server
# n = oper can send local server notices(/notice $servername message)
# G = oper can send global server notices(/notce $*.my.net message)
# A = admin
# u = oper can set /umode +c
# f = oper can set /umode +f
# ^ = oper can set /umode +I
# e = oper can set /umode +e
# W = oper can set /umode +W
# H = oper gets auto +x on /oper
# o = local oper, flags included: rhgwlckbBnuf
# O = global oper, flags included: oRDCK
# a = services admin, access to /samode
# C = co admin
# A = admin
# N = network admin access to remote /rehash and remote /restart and a bunch more
# * = flags included: AaNCTzSHW^

#
# This is a plain vanilla O:line:
O:*.toledolink.com:nopassword:Russell:*:10
#
# and this line forces ident:
O:rmiller@glass.toledolink.com:nopassword:Russell::10
# 
# This line is a generic "local operator", because of the flags, the only
# thing that really makes them global operators, is if they have the flags
# CKN set in their access flags.
#
# this line permits the nickname "jhs" with the password of "ITBites" to
# be a local operator only (be able to issue commands locally -- can /kill
# and /squit and /connect -- but *only* locally)
#
O:*.something.net:ITBites:jhs:o:10
#
# a crypted password line (NOTE that if you have crypted passwords, *all*
# of you passwords must be crypted! In fact, if you are getting an error
# "Incorrect Password" it may well be because crypted passwords are
# defined and you have used plaintext.  So my example of plaintext and
# crypted strings in the same IRC server configuration file is an
# impossibility (but it is just theoretical, which is why I explained both).
#
O:rmiller@*.toledolink.com:T0eiVgHrqeKTQ:Russell::10
#
# U: [OPTIONAL]. This line defines the servers that IRC recognizes as being
# allowed to make various changes to the IRC environment (mode changes, for
# example), without complaining or otherwise obstructing them. For example,
# DALnet requires the following line:
U:services.my.net:*:*
#
# X: [ENCOURAGED]. This line defines the password that an operator must use
# to restart or die the server. Note that they still myst have they R and D
# flags. This is just a security precaution against  accidentaly typing
# /die or /restart
# X:<password for /DIE>:<password for /RESTART>
X:diepass:restartpass

# C: [NETWORKED]. These lines define what servers your server tries to
# connect to. 
# N: [NETWORKED]. These lines define what servers your server permits
# connections to be initiated from. 
# C/N lines MUST be used in pairs. You cannot have one without the other. 
#
# C: lines contain the following fields:
# C:remote server's hostname:passwd:remote server's name:port:conn class:options
# N: lines contain the following fields:
# N:remote server's hostname:passwd:remote server's name:host mask:conn class
#
# "host mask" is the number of parts in *your* hostname to mask to. For
# instance, with my servername being "csa.bu.edu", if I wanted to present
# my servername to be "*.bu.edu" I would have a host-mask portion of "1". 
#
# it is *strongly* advised that your C/N line passwords be different for
# security's sake.
#
# ident is allowed in the server's hostname part of the field.
# The options field in a C:line is only available as of Unreal3.1.1
# Currently the only option is S which declares the link an SSL link.
# If the other server is not compiled with SSL then the link will fail.
#
# these lines tell the server to automatically (note the port number, that
# means automatic connection) connect to server2.my.net:
C:foobar@server2.my.net:bigspark:server2.my.net:7000:32
N:foobar@server2.my.net:bigalpha:server2.my.net::32
#
# This server's connection lines are more vanilla, masking the host to
# *.toledolink.com (as described above):
C:*.my.net:camelsrk00l:*.my.net::32
N:*.my.net:andsoarellamas:*.my.net:1:32
#
# This this line makes use of the options field:
# C:*.my.net:linkme:*.my.net:6667:32:S
# N:*.my.net:linkme:*.my.net::32
#
# K: [OPTIONAL]. These lines define user@host patterns to be banned from
# this particular server (with an optional time field). Note that K: lines
# are *not* global, and if you ban a user they can still use any other IRC
# server (unless they have specifically been banned there as well).
#
# The time field (same as reason) is only used if you #define
# TIMED_KLINES in config.h, and even then they are discouraged.
# 
# the fields are defined as:
# K:hostmask:reason:username
# wildcards are permitted in any one of the fields, in other words, you can
# K:*::* if you wanted (but your server wouldn't be used much ;-)
#
# Spaces are permitted in the reason field (you don't have to use _).
# The /stats command has been modified to replace all spaces with _'s when
# doing a /stats k. K:lines also allows you to specify a file to play to the
# user when they are K:lined. To use this feature the reason must be in the
# format of |filename. the filename must be kc.anythinghere, this is to prevent
# the sending of text files such as your ircd.conf.
#
# This K: line bans the username "hrose" (the wildcards are used to make
# sure that any ident-checking character will match) on any machine from
# the University of Boston.
K:*.bu.edu:Hacking #UnrealIRCD:*hrose*
#
# This K: line bans any users from acs*.bu.edu between the hours of 8am
# and 12pm and 1pm and 5pm (the time is always the server's local time).
# Time-based K-lines such as this require TIMED_KLINES in config.h to be
# #defined.
K:acs*.bu.edu:0800-1200,1300-1700:*
# Note that 24 hour time is used (no "AM" or "PM").
# This K: line bans all *.foobar.com users and will play the file |kc.flooding
# to the user as the reason.
K:*.foobar.com:|kc.flooding:*
# 
# E: [OPTIONAL]. This allows kline exceptions, even if a person matches
# a K:line or /kline they are still allowed to connect.
#
# The fields are as follows
# E:hostmask:reason:usermask
# 
E:foo.bar.com:Oper on this server:*john21*
#
#
# q: [DISCOURAGED]. These lines "quarantine" specified servers.  Because
# of the way they operates, the same q: lines MUST be installed by
# everyone or the net will keep breaking. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH.
# Do NOT use q: lines lightly!
#
# This is NOT a nick q-line, if you wish to quarantine a NICK, see below.
#
# The fields are as follows:
# q:*:reason why quarantine is in place:servername
#
q::this server is too slow and lags the net:cm5.eng.umd.edu
#
# Q: [OPTIONAL]. Different from the above type of q: line, these lines
# prevent users on your server from picking certain nicks. This is useful
# if your network has 'reserved' nicknames that should not be taken by
# normal users.  Note the difference in capitalization and BE CAREFUL!
#
# The fields are as follows:
# Q:*:reason why quarantine is in place:nickname
#
# For example, You might want to use the following lines:
Q::Reserved for services:ChanServ
Q::Reserved for services:NickServ
Q::Reserved for services:MemoServ
Q::Reserved for services:OperServ
Q::Reserved for services:HelpServ
Q::Reserved for services:StatServ
Q::Reserved for operators:IRCop
Q::Reserved for operators:*Oper*
Q::Reserved for administrators:Admin*
#
# 
# T: [OPTIONAL]. These allow you to specify different MOTD and RULES files
# based on a users host.  This is made so you can have MOTDs in different
# languages so all users can see the MOTD and understand it.
#
# The fields are as follows:
# T:host:motdfile:rulesfile
#
# T:*.fr:french.motd:french.rules
#
#
# e: [OPTIONAL]. These lines allow you to specify a host which will not 
# be scanned by the proxy scanner when they connect. This is made so you
# can allow some open proxys to connect while still killing others. Make
# sure you use an IP and not a host for this line or it will not work.
# NOTE: These are not the same as E:lines.
#
# The fields are as follows:
# e:IP:*:*
#
# e:123.123.123:*:*
#
#
# Z: [DISCOURAGED]. These block ALL incoming connections from a certain
# IP address mask.  They can stop users who log on and issue the SERVER
# command a couple of times just to annoy irc ops.  They are more
# powerful that K-lines because they can stop users before they've had a
# chance to register.  This works on servers, SO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH
# YOUR Z-LINE MASKS.  Z-lines are a LAST RESORT.  They are much too
# dangerous and powerful to be using them instead of K-lines and akills.
#
# NOTE 1: Z-lines do NOT work on host names!  Only IP addresses.
# NOTE 2: Z-lines are part of /stats k.  
# NOTE 3: The :* at the end is REQUIRED.  Not using it will cause both
# ircd and chkconf to segfault without saying why.
#
# Syntax:
# Z:IP mask:reason for zapping:*
Z:127.0.0.1:Please don't log on from the local machine:*
#
# L: [OPTIONAL]. These lines "Leaf" specified servers. They are only
# useful if you are a non-leaf site yourself. There are two ways you can
# use L: lines. The first will limit one particular site to a particular
# tree depth (including 0, which would mean the server has to connect with
# no servers linked behind it otherwise the connection will fail). The
# second will allow you to be selective about which other servers you wish
# the connecting server to behave as a leaf towards.
#
# The fields are as follows:
# L:disallow connections to this hostmask::server name:depth
# For example, this will force kaja.gi.alaska.edu to connect only as a
# leaf (if it is not a leaf, the link will be dropped):
L:::kaja.gi.alaska.edu
# This line will force cm5.eng.umd.edu to have a depth of only 1 below it
# (that is, it is allowed to have only leaves connected to it):
L:::cm5.eng.umd.edu:1
#
# This line will prohibit anything matching *.edu to be connected behind
# any server matching *.au:
L:*.edu::*.au
#
# H: [OPTIONAL]. These lines define who you permit to act as a "hub" to
# you (that is, who you permit to connect non-leafed servers to you).
#
# the first field may use wildcards, the third field *must* be an exact
# match for a server's name (NOT a server's hostname, if they differ, the
# server's name must be used). If the servername is a wildcard (e.g. *.au)
# that is an acceptable name for the third field. 
#
# The fields are as follows:
# H:servers which are permitted entry::hub server
#
# Example, permit server.my.net to allow any servers behind it to 
# connect: 
H:*::server2.my.net
#
# Example, permit irc-2.mit.edu to allow any MIT servers behind it to
# connect: 
H:*.mit.edu::irc-2.mit.edu
#
# P: [OPTIONAL]. This field allows the server to listen on various ports
# (other than 7000) for connections.
#
# You can now bind internet ports to specific IP interface devices.  To do
# this put the IP address of the interface in the host field.  To bind to
# all interfaces, leave empty or put * in.
#
# P:lines can be limited to specific connections. For example you can make
# a port listen for only server connections. The currently available flags
# are:
#
# S - Server Only
# C - Client(User) Only
# J - JavaChat (for CR Java Client)
# s - Secure SSL
# * - CS flags
#
# The fields are as follows::
# P:IP# or UNIX socket file:*:*:port number
# for example, an internet domain socket on port 6665 for the local
# computer
P:127.0.0.1:*:*:6665
#
# Examples using flags
P:127.0.0.1:S:*:6666
P:127.0.0.1:C:*:7000
#
# V: [OPTIONAL]. These lines are very complex and allow you to deny a 
# server from linking based on what version of Unreal they are running,
# as well as what flags the IRCd was compiled with.
#
# The fields are as follows:
# V:protocol:flags:servermask
# 
# The format for the protocol field is as follows:
# >protocol - denys any protocols higher than that specified
# <protocol - denys any protocols lower than that specified
# =protocol - denys the specified protocol
# !protocol - denys all but the specified protocol
#
# The format for the flags field is as follows:
# flag - server must have the specifed flag
# !flag - server may not have the specified flag
#
# Examples:
# V:<2302:*:*
# V:*:S:hub.*
# V:=2301:!S:*
