==[ IMPORTANT MESSAGE ABOUT DISABLING NOSPOOF ]==
Disabling NOSPOOF at windows (w9x, nt, w2k, xp) is NOT recommended since this
will allow users to use "spoofed hosts" (like the IP of someone you trust).
If you got problems with NOSPOOF fix your client (bot?) instead (you should
PONG back to the initial PING at connect).

==[ HOW TO COMPILE UNREALIRCD WITHOUT SSL AT WINDOWS ]==
1. You need Microsoft Visual C++

== VC++ 6.0 ==
2. You need the Platform SDK (PSDK)
   Grab it at: http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/ ->
   core sdk -> install this sdk.
   Note that this can take some time to download because it's >200Mb
   (450mb installed) [!].
3. To compile:
   start -> programs -> platform sdk blabla -> open build env. -> (choose os) ->
   set blabla build env (debug). This will launch a DOS window.
4. Go to your UnrealIrcd dir (like: cd \dev\unreal3.2) and then compile with:
   nmake -f makefile.win32
   This will generate a wircd.exe and unreal.exe
5. Copy the src\win32\gnu_regex.dll to your UnrealIrcd main dir.
6. Done!

== VC++ 7.x (.NET) ==
2. Start the Visual Studio .NET Command Prompt
3. Go to your UnrealIrcd dir (like: cd \dev\unreal3.2) and then compile with:
   nmake -f makefile.win32
   This will generate a wircd.exe and unreal.exe
4. Copy the src\win32\gnu_regex.dll to your UnrealIrcd main dir.
5. Done!

==[ HOW TO COMPILE UNREALIRCD WITH SSL AT WINDOWS ]==
Ouch, that's much work ;).
You need to compile openssl and have it installed in c:\openssl.
Then use makefile.win32.ssl instead of makefile.win32.
And don't ask us for help on how to compile openssl...

==[ AND ZIP LINKS SUPPORT? ]==
See top of makefile.win32.ziplink for instructions.
