Compiling UnrealIRCd 3.1.x for Windows
--------------------------------------
This document assumes you have a working build environment for
Visual Studio .NET or Visual Studio 6.0. Other versions may work
as well, but have not been tested.

1. Copy include/win32/settings.h and setup.h to include/
2. Copy extras/regex/regex.h to include/
3. Copy extras/regex/regex.c to src/
4. Edit include/settings.h to your liking (pretty much change DOMAINNAME)
5. Execute "nmake makefile.win32"

Congratulations, you should have a functioning win32 binary.
