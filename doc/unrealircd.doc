        [ $Id$ ]

1) About UnrealIRCd

  	I started making UnrealIRCd about 1-2 months ago. (July 1999 now)
  	First it was called mpx2.0b13.soundforge - as I was
  	inspired of the 'forge' word. I quickly changed name
  	after I realized the IRCd had more potential.
        Unreal is based off Elite2.0b13 and some of
  	the minor bugfixes Potvin came up with. First lemme
  	introduce myself. My nick is Techie/Stskeeps. I hang
  	out at Global-IRC.net, DALnet, DragonWings.org and so on
  	
	Unreal is a hybrid of Elite (as I said) mixed with some
	Twilight IRCd, TerraIRCd, TS4 (channel mode +h & +e) features
	(IMHO TwilightIRCd is one of the best dreamforge hybrids I've seen!
	Unreal is not a rip-off of other IRCds - I added a lot of features myself!
	I really cannot mention some major features as I think a IRCd is a
	IRCd when it has got useful commands- and people actually say mine has!
	
	Anyways I dunt demand donations or anything. I just do coding for fun
	I treat coding like playing with toys. It makes me happy(or is it just
	caffeine?;). An addy to send donations is at the Donation file in the IRCd dir
	And.. I don't sweat while making features unlike some Potvin coder so dunt
	send me towels;) I would be more happy if someone e-mailed me with ideas
	to the IRCd.. The whole IRCd is GNU so if you want to rip off any of my ideas
	You are generally welcome:) Just remember to do what's said in the Changes file!
	-- So.. Enjoy this IRCd:) It may become a dream to IRCd owners as its infact
	   a sortof hybrid of EliteIRCd (Cite .man-pages/page1 in Elite:
	EliteIRCD has become a dream to many ircd owners</end cite>
	   -- Carsten Munk / Techie .. =)

2) Commands (User Commands)

       *** WATCH Command ***
	Watch is a new notify-type system in UnrealIRCd which is both faster
	and uses less network resources than any old-style notify
	system. You may add entries to your Watch list with the command
	/watch +nick1 [+nick2 +nick3 ..., and the server will send
	you a message when any nickname in your watch list logs on or off.
	Use /watch -nick to remove a nickname from the watch list, and
	just /watch to view your watch list.
	The watch list DOES NOT REMAIN BETWEEN SESSIONS - you (or your
	script or client) must add the nicknames to your watch list every
	time you connect to an IRC server. /Watch was made in DreamForge IRCd
	which UnrealIRCd in ground is based off

   	 *** HELPOP Command ***
   	HelpOp is a new system of getting IRC Server help. You type either
   	/HelpOp ? <help system topic>  or /HelpOp ! <question>
   	The "?" in /HelpOp means query the help system and if you get no
   	response you can choose '!' to send it to the Help Operators online
   	------------oOo--------------

     *** LIST Command ***
	New extended /list command options are supported.  To use these
	features, you will likely need to prefix the LIST command with
	/quote to avoid your client interpreting the command.

	Usage: /quote LIST options
	
	If you don't include any options, the default is to send you the
	entire unfiltered list of channels. Below are the options you can
	use, and what channels LIST will return when you use them.
	>number  List channels with more than <number> people.
	<number  List channels with less than <number> people.
	C>number List channels created between now and <number> minutes ago.
	C<number List channels created earlier than <number> minutes ago.
	T>number List channels whose topics are older than <number> minutes
	         (Ie., they have not changed in the last <number> minutes.
	T<number List channels whose topics are newer than <number> minutes.
	*mask*   List channels that match *mask*
	!*mask*  List channels that do not match *mask*
	LIST defaults to sending a list of channels with 2 or more members,
	so use the >0 option to get the full channel listing.  

		*** PRIVMSG Command ***
	PRIVMSG and NOTICE, which are used internally by the client for
	/msg and /notice, in UnrealIRCd support two additional formats:
	/msg @#channel <text> will send the text to channel-ops on the
	given channel only. /msg @+#channel <text> will send the text
	to both ops and voiced users on the channel. While some clients
	may support these as-is, on others (such as ircII), it's necessary
	to use /quote privmsg @#channel <text> instead. It's perhaps a
	good idea to add the/alias omsg /quote privmsg @$0 $1 into
	your script (.ircrc) file in that case.

	**** KNOCK Command ****
	/Knock is a new UnrealIRCd command which enables you to
	'knock' on a channel if it is +i and these criteria is met
	- Channel is not +K (No knocks)
	- Channel is not +I (No invites!)
	- You're not banned!
	- And you are not already there:)

	Syntax:
      /Knock #Channel :Reason
     
      **** LICENSE Command ****
 	This command shows the GNU License
 	Which is hard-coded into the IRCd:)
	Syntax: /License [optional server]

   	(GECOS) directly online at IRC without reconnecting
   	
	Syntax:
   	/SetName :New Real Name


   	*** MODE Command ***
   	This is basically the /mode command as it has always
   	been on IRC. Thou in Channel mode basis it has got an
   	Extra feature (/mode #Channel ^ ) which reports channel
   	modes represented in a bitstring (may be handy, maybe not)
   	UnrealIRCd has got some new channel / usermodes I think you
   	wish to take a look at
   	Channel Modes Help: /HelpOp CHMODES
   	User modes help: /HelpOp UMODES
 
	*** STATSERV Command ***
  	This is a alias for the /msg StatServ command,
   	But is more secure. If the IRC network doesn't have StatServ
   	It will report it is down.
   	
	Syntax:
   	/StatServ <command>

   	*** /Credits Help ***
  	This command will list the credits I've created
   	to thank the people who has helped me with making
   	UnrealIRCd. Anyone who I've forgotten all my kind
