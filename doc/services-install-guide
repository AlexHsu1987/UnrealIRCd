First  of all  you will  be required  to download  a services  package for  your
network.

A few of the most popular services are:

	IRCServices	-	http://www.ircservices.za.net/ 
	Epona		-	http://www.pegsoft.net/epona/
	Wrecked		-	http://www.wrecked.net/services/index.html  
	Magick		-       http://www.magick.tm/           
	Sirius		-	http://ircsystems.net/sirius       

After you  have downloaded  the appropriate  services package,  you will have to
upload it to  your shell, and  untar and un-gzip  the file by  typing: tar -zxvf
services.x.x.tar.gz

Then you will need to enter the directory created by your services package  (for
a listing type ls -a) and type ./configure . This will run the configure  script
to setup your  services. The script  will ask you  questions regarding the  path
want to install your services to, where  you want the services data files to  be
installed to, encryption options, and the type of ircd that you are using  (Most
probably Unreal).  If  you have previously  used any other  services package, it
may also ask you if you would like to convert their databases.  It may also  ask
you if you would like the services to dump a core file when a segmentation fault
occurs so that you can find out the  cause of the problem and bug report to  the
developers of the ircd services.

Then you will be required to  compile your services package by typing  "make" or
possibly  "gmake".  To  install services  after compiled,  type "make  install".
Then you will need  to enter the directory  that you specified for  the location
for the data of the services.  You  will most likely see a example.conf file  in
the folder.  You will  need to rename this  file to services.conf by  typing "mv
example.conf services.conf"  and then  you will  need to  edit the services.conf
file in your favourite  text editor.  We recommend  new users use pico,  to edit
the file using  pico type "pico  services.conf". Edit the  file to your  liking,
make sure you follow their recommendations  in settings, and make sure you  edit
the root services passwords, server to link to, password and port.

After you have configured your services  you will then be required to  edit your
unrealircd.conf.  You will require to add server connection lines to your server
in order for services to work.  All  services on your network will need to  have
the same U  line as the  server that services  are linking to.  A sample of  the
configuration for services for unrealircd.conf is listed below:

link   services.yournetwork.net  {  
	username	 *;   
	hostname	0.0.0.0;   /*Server Ip Address Or Hostmask */ 
	bind-ip		*; /* IP To Bind To When Connecting  */  
	port		 6667;   /* Port Number */   
	password-connect "passwordsend";  /*Password To Send On Connection*/  
	password-receive "passwordreceive"; 	/* Password To Receive From 
						Server Connecting */ 
	class	servers; 
	options { autoconnect; }; 
};

Make sure  you then  add a  u:line entry  for services.  All the servers on your
network will  be required  to have  a U:line.   For UnrealIRCD  3.2 the  U:lines
should look something like this:

ulines {
	services.yournetwork.net;
};

Servers Running UnrealIRCD 3.1.1 Darkshades or below the U:Line for the  servers
should look something like this:

	U:services.yournetwork.net:*:*

You will then be required  to edit your unrealircd.conf's network  configuration
services name line, which  has to be the  same name as chosen  on the connection
line for your services. ie. in  this case your network configuration line  would
look something like:

	services-name 		"services.yournetwork.net";

Then you will  require to /rehash  your ircd and  then go back  to your services
directory and type ./services to run services.
