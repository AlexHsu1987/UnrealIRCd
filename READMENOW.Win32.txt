Unreal IRCD Win32 Version
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Ok, in order to save time, and my nerves i am writing this short readme, and eventually an FAQ (after people ask questions) =)

This is information on how to run the win32 version, it does not say, and WILL not say how to use an ircd, as that is sufficiently docuimented in the docs !!!!

you will NEED to modify/create an ircd.conf, follow the documentation for that.


Right, thats almost it( that i can think of), but what happens if the server Crashes ???
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ok i Have now coded the first bit of usefull (for me) code that dumps the stack to a dialog box, WHAT EVER YOU DO you must do the following:
		1. Copy and paste EVERYTHING in that dialog box, and send it to me in an e-mail
		2. Include in that e-mail EVERYTHING that happened in the lead up to the crash

i hope thats SIMPLE to follow, but it will help me soo much !!!!!
