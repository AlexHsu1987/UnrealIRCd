             Dynamic Configuration Guide

- Edit ircd.conf to correctly reflect your server configuration.

- Edit networks/unrealircd.conf to suit you. If you're going
to use your own network file (encouraged), change the "Include"
line to point to your own network file.

- Assuming you do want your own network file, copy template.network
in networks/ to yourircnet.network. Edit it to your liking.

If you've completed all these steps *correctly* your server should
start up without any problems. If there are errors, there is an
extremely high chance that it's due to user configuration error.
Please read the documentation and check over your configuration files
before contacting us.

If the problem persists, and you cannot fix it, email luke@unrealircd.com
or come on irc.ircsystems.net and /join #unreal-support.
