             Dynamic Configuration Guide

Okay first you have to go edit the file "unrealircd.conf" in 
the directory "networks/". In that file you see a field with
name "Include" .. if you want to create your own network file
(IRC network specification) you have to write like 
"networks/<irc network>.network" like "networks/myircnetwork.network"

If there is already a network file you can just put in the path
like : "networks/dragonwings.org"

If you want to create your own network file 
copy the file "template.network" to the name you want to use for 
your network file and edit it.
