Fri Jan  2 16:14:37 2004  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-match-backtrack.c (tre_tnfa_run_backtrack): Fixed to
	compile if TRE_DEBUG is defined but TRE_WCHAR is not.  Thanks to
	Dominick Meglio for pointing this out.

Fri Jan  2 09:53:02 2004  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-compile.c (tre_copy_ast): Bugfix.  Did not recurse when
	handling an iteration node, and everything under the node was not
	genuinely copied but only referenced.  This caused things like
	"(a+){5}" not to work correctly; this example was basically
	equivalent to "a*" but in a very very slow way.

Mon Dec 22 10:31:16 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* Released tre-0.6.3.

Sun Dec 14 11:22:58 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* Bugfix.  Back references did not work if REG_NOSUB was used when
	compiling the regexp.

Tue Dec  2 16:06:37 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* Small fixes and changes here and there to avoid compiler
	warnings.

	* lib/tre-match-backtrack.c (tre_tnfa_run_backtrack): Fixed to
	compile if TRE_WCHAR is not defined.

	* lib/tre-mem.c (tre_mem_alloc_impl): Bugfix.  When a new block was
	allocated with malloc() the next tre_mem_alloc() returned a
	possibly unaligned pointer.
	
Sun Nov 23 21:52:58 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* Released tre-0.6.2.

Sun Nov 23 18:40:57 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-match-backtrack.c (tre_tnfa_run_backtrack): Bugfix.
	If the TNFA has a loop with an empty back reference, the matcher
	went to an infinite loop.   This happened e.g. with the regexp
	"()(\1)*".

	* lib/regexec.c (tre_match_approx): Fixed to return error if the
	regexp has back references.

	* lib/tre-compile.c (tre_parse): Bugfix in parsing empty
	expressions and missing closing parentheses.

Sun Nov 16 20:27:17 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-match-approx.c (tre_tnfa_run_approx): Fixed a bug which
	caused non-optimal matches to be returned in some cases.

	* tests/retest.c: Added a couple of tests.
	
Sat Nov 15 15:21:23 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-compile.c (tre_expand_ast): Fixed to handle nested
	repeats correctly.

Wed Nov 12 21:45:44 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-compile.c: Fixed to compile if REG_LITERAL is not
	defined.

	* lib/tre-match-backtrack.c: Fixed to compile without wide
	character support.

Thu Nov  6 22:23:03 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-match-parallel.c: Bugfix.  If pmatch[] was null, the
	matcher loop referred past an array, sometimes crashing.
	
Mon Nov  3 17:41:37 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* Released tre-0.6.0.

Sun Nov  2 20:27:37 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-compile.c (tre_parse): Implemented support for
	REG_LITERAL.  If REG_LITERAL is used, the entire regexp is
	interpreted as a literal word.

Tue Oct 14 21:20:35 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-compile.c: Changed the parser to use a context object
	which contains all parse state instead of passing each state
	variable separately.  Fixed bug that caused `have_backrefs' to be
	reset if macros were used (this caused the wrong matcher to be
	used and back references not to work).

Mon Sep 29 21:43:35 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* Added a "tre_" prefix to all functions that did not yet have it.

	* lib/tre-compile.c: Separated regexp compilation from regcomp.c
	to this file.  Now all actual functionality is implemeted in
	lib/tre-*.c, and lib/reg*.c have the POSIX API wrappers.

	* Implemented new syntax to control approximate matching
	parameters dynamically during matching.  Thanks to Bill Yerazunis
	for the suggestions!

Wed Sep  3 19:41:40 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-match-backtrack.c (tre_tnfa_run_backtrack): Bugfix.  Now
	matching back references works correctly in wide character mode.

Thu Jul  3 19:47:33 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* configure.ac: Made --disable-system-abi the default.

	* configure.ac: alloca() is no longer required.  Unless
	--without-alloca is specified, alloca() will be used if found.

Fri May 15 09:39:34 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* tre/tre-match-approx.c (tre_tnfa_run_approx): Bugfix in handling
	insertions.  If an insertion was found that had better cost than a
	previous path, the tag values were not copied resulting in
	incorrect match and submatch positions being reported.

Wed May 14 21:14:47 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* Released tre-0.5.3.

Wed May 14 20:11:43 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* tre/tre-mem.c (tre_mem_alloc_impl): Bugfix.  The returned
	pointer was not always properly aligned.

Tue May 13 19:55:30 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* configure.ac, lib/regex.h, lib/tre-internal.h: Fixed to compile
	if --disable-system-abi is used.

	* lib/Makefile.am: Fixed to use $(LTLIBINTL), so gettext is found
	on systems where it is not in libc (e.g. FreeBSD has it in
	libintl).

	Thanks to Dominick Meglio <codemstr@ptdprolog.net> for the above!
	
Thu May  8 21:23:30 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* win32/config.h, win32/tre-config.h: Updated and fixed
	compilation errors on Windows.  Enabled wide character and
	multibyte support.

	* win32/tre.dsp, win32/retest.dsp: Link against msvcprt.lib to get
	wide character functions.

	* src/retest.c: Don't try to call setlocale() on Windows (it seems
	to crash).

	* lib/regcomp.c (parse_re): Fixed bugs in the regexp parser when
	wide character support is not used.  Also fixed some references
	past the end of the input string.

	* lib/regex.h: regcomp, regexec, regerror, and regfree weren't
	defined if TRE_WCHAR was not defined.  Fixed.
	
Tue Apr 15 22:37:48 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-match-approx.c (tre_tnfa_run_approx): Fixed bugs.  A
	match starting earlier was sometimes preferred over a match with a
	smaller cost, and insertions were not handled correctly.

	* src/agrep.c: Implemented the -B (best match) mode.  It scans the
	input files twice; first to find out what is the cost of the best
	matching record(s), and another time to output all records that
	match with that cost.

	* test/test-approx.c: Added some simple test cases.
	
Sun Apr 13 13:53:00 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* doc/tre-api.html, doc/tre-syntax.html: Beginnings of
	API and regexp syntax documentation.

	* lib/tre-mem.c: Changed to allocate blocks bigger than
	TRE_MEM_BLOCK_SIZE if the requested amount is large.  This fixes
	REG_ESPACE problems when trying to compile large regexps,
	especially ones with a lot of "|".

	* Released tre-0.5.2.

Mon Apr  7 18:39:05 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/regcomp.c, lib/tre-match-parallel.c: Added support for
	non-greedy repetition operators "*?", "+?", "??", and "{m,n}?".
	They work similarly to the ones in Perl.

	* tests/retest.c: Added tests for minimal repetition operators.
	
	* tre.pc.in: Added pkgconfig file.

Tue Apr  1 20:20:37 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-match-parallel.c, lib/tre-match-approx.c: Fixed
	alignment bugs when allocating pointers from a buffer.

Sat Mar 15 20:35:11 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/regcomp.c (parse_re): Fixed to allow the empty regexp.
	These were already allowed inside parentheses (e.g. "(a|)"), but
	e.g. "a|" caused REG_EPAREN to be returned.  Now "", "a|", "|a",
	"*", "?", etc. work as expected.

Thu Mar 13 19:49:20 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-match-backtrack.c: Bugfix.  Stopped too early when
	scanning asciiz strings.

	* configure.in: System ABI support: added checks for absolute path
	to regex.h and a field in the system defined regex_t suitable for
	storing a pointer to a TNFA.  TRE is now configured by default to
	be compatible with the system regex ABI, unless
	--disable-system-abi is used.

	* lib/regex.h, lib/tre-config.h.in: System ABI support: if
	TRE_USE_SYSTEM_REGEX_H if defined, include system regex.h instead
	of defining everything here. 

	* lib/regcomp.c, lib/regexec.c, lib/tre-config.h.in:
	System ABI support: use the configured field in regex_t struct for
	getting and setting the pointer to the TFNA.

Thu Feb 27 19:32:43 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-match-*.[ch]: Fixed several references past the end of
	the input string.

	* lib/tre-match-approx.c: Fixed bugs in submatch tracking.

	* configure.in: Added flag --disable-agrep to disable building and
	installing agrep.
	
	* Released tre-0.5.1.
	
Sun Feb 23 14:43:06 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* Released tre-0.5.0.

Fri Feb 21 19:10:30 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* win32/: New directory, contains project and workspace files for
	compiling TRE and `retest' for Windows with MS Visual C++.
	Original version contributed by Aymeric Moizard <jack@atosc.org>,
	thank you!

Sun Feb 16 12:55:13 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/regcomp.c: Rewrote code that adds tags in the AST for
	submatch addressing.  Changes include:
	  - Submatch boundaries now all have a tag with offset zero.  This
	    makes it possible to get correct submatches for approximate
	    matches.
	  - Removed marker and boundary tags.  Now nested submatches are
	    tracked and that information is used to reset submatches from
	    old repetitions.
	  - Bounded iterations are now expanded after adding tags instead
	    of at parse time.  This makes the code a lot cleaner.
	  
	* lib/regexec.c, lib/tre-internal.h: Related changes (no more
	marker and boundary tags).

	* tests/test-approx.c: Small test program for approximate
	matcher.

Mon Jan 13 20:28:52 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/tre-match-approx.c: Now returns submatches of approximate
	matches in the `pmatch[]' array of the `regamatch_t' struct.

Sun Jan 12 13:52:37 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/regexec.c, lib/regex.h: Changed API of approximate matching
	functions.  This API is easier to extend without having to change
	the applications using the API at all.

	* src/agrep.c: New command line option --show-cost (-s) to prefix
	the cost of the match found to each output line.

	* tests/retest.c: Added tests for back referencing.

	* lib/*: Rearranged stuff.  Split all three matchers (parallel,
	approximate, backtracking) into separate files.  Put tre-mem into
	its own files.

Mon Jan  6 21:18:12 2003  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* utils/autogen.sh: Fixed (must run aclocal before automake).

	* m4/vl_check_sign.m4, m4/vl_decl_wchar_max.m4, configure.in:
	Updated for new autoconf style (AC_TRY_COMPILE ->
	AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, AC_ERROR -> AC_MSG_ERROR, etc.)

	* lib/regcomp.c, lib/regexec.c, lib/regexec-bt.c, lib/tre.h:
	Implemented support for back references.  A backtracking routine
	implemented in `regex-bt.c' is used instead of the parallel
	matcher if back references are used is the regexp.

Fri Nov 29 20:57:52 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* configure.in: New options --disable-wchar and
	--disable-multibyte that disable wchar_t support (and requirement)
	and multibyte character support, respectively.

	* lib/regcomp.c, lib/regex.h, lib/regexec.c, lib/tre.h: Related
	changes.

Sun Oct 20 21:55:56 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* configure.in: Check getopt_long support.

	* lib/regcomp.c (ast_compute_tag_info): Merged into ast_add_tags
	and removed this function.
	
	* lib/regcomp.c (ast_add_tags, parse_re, parse_bound): Bugfixes.
	Range repetition did not work correctly when applied to a 
	parenthesized subexpression.  For example, "a{5,6}" worked correctly,
	but "(a|b){5,6}" did not.

Sun Oct 20 20:27:24 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* Changed the name of the package from "libtre" to just "TRE".
	
	* lib/regexec.c (tnfa_execute_approx): Implemented approximate
	regexp matching.

	* lib/regex.h (regaexec, reganexec, regawexec, regawnexec):
	Added approximate matching API.

	* src/agrep.c: First version of agrep (approximate grep).  Uses
	the new approximate matching feature in the matcher library.

	* lib/regexec.c (tnfa_execute): Added a loop to quickly skip over
	characters that cannot possibly be the first character of a
	match.
	
	* lib/regcomp.c (regwncomp): Related changes.
	
Sat Aug  3 23:42:29 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* Moved the library part from src/ to lib/, and changed the name of
	macros/ to m4/.

	* lib/regex.c: Split into `regcomp.c', `regexec.c', and
	`regerror.c'.

	* lib/regerror.c, lib/regex.h: Threw away regwerror() since it was
	pretty useless.

	* lib/regerror.c: Internationalized.  The error messages returned
	by regerror() are now localized through gettext() if found.
	Note that libintl is *not* included in the TRE package.

	* po/fi.po: Finnish translation.
	
	* lib/regcomp.c (parse_re): Fixed bugs (there were references to
	before the start of the regexp string).

	* lib/regcomp.c (parse_re): Fixed bugs in parsing BREs.

	* tests/retest.c: Added test cases for the BRE stuff I fixed.

	* lib/regexec.c (tnfa_execute): Fixed to work when the length of
	the input string is given (e.g. with regnexec()).
	
Sun Jul 28 00:19:04 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* lib/Makefile.am: Changed to install the header file `regex.h' to
	$(includedir)/tre to avoid accidental inclusion with
	"#include <regex.h>".

Mon Jun 24 19:34:50 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* src/regex.c (ast_compute_nfl): Bugfix, did not mark an iteration
	node as nullable if the minimum number of iterations was above
	zero and the child was nullable.  As a result, e.g. "(a*)+" did not
	match the empty string.

	* src/regex.c (ast_compute_tag_info): Bugfix, the tree was
	traversed in the wrong order resulting in incorrect num_tags
	counts for nodes in some cases.  The results ranged from missing
	submatches to segfaults. 

	* src/regex.c (make_transitions): Bugfix, if a transition between
	two states was already handled then the code aborted the loop when
	it should have just skipped to the next iteration.  The result was
	that sometimes some transitions were not added to the NFA and
	matches were not found.

	* src/regex.c (parse_bracket_items): Bugfix, referred one or two
	characters past the end of the string in several places.  E.g.
	compiling the regex "[a-" could cause a segfault.   

	* src/regex.c (fill_pmatch): Bugfix.  If the marker boundary tag
	number is bigger than tnfa->num_tags, the marker boundary tag
	does not exist (or rather it does, but is the same as the match
	end point).  The code here still used marker_boundary even if it
	was bigger than num_tags, causing either segfaults, missing
	submatches, or no symptoms.

	* src/regex.c (tnfa_execute): Bugfix.  When matches were found,
	the first tag value was checked to be smaller than for the
	previous match.  Firstly, this was a redundant and useless check.
	Secondly, it caused a segfault if REG_NOSUB was used when
	compiling the regexp since there are no tags in that case and the
	array is NULL.
	
	* tests/retest.c: Added tests for all of the above.  Thanks to
	Glenn Fowler for running into the bugs and providing the test
	cases.

	* Released libtre-0.3.2.

Wed Mar 27 21:48:48 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* src/regex.c: Added support for new zero-width assertions \b, \B,
	\<, and \>.  Fixed a bug in ^ and $.

	* src/regex.c (parse_bound): Bugfix, had forgotten to handle
	boundaries of the form "{12,}" altogether.

	* src/regex.c (ast_add_tags): Bugfix, set the direction of the
	current tag to MAXIMIZE at ADDTAGS_POST_CATENATION, but should not
	have.

	* src/regex.c (parse_re): A `)' is now interpreted as an ordinary
	character in the absence of a matched `('.

	* src/regex.c (regwncomp): Bugfix, did not set preg->re_nsub to
	the number of parenthesized subexpressions.

	* tests/retest.c: Added tests for all of the above.

	* src/regex.c: Fixed to be completely thread safe.  A single
	compiled regexp can now be used simultaneously in several
	contexts, e.g. in main() and a signal handler, or multiple
	threads.
	
Wed Mar 20 19:50:37 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* src/regex.c: Added support for Perl-compatible syntax
	extensions: \t, \n, \r, \f, \a, \e, \w, \W, \s, \S, \d, \D.

	* src/regex.c: Now expands character classes when using 8 bit
	character sets so that iswctype() calls are avoided during
	matching.

Sun Mar  3 17:50:14 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* macros/*: Updated all macros (they were renamed from AC_* to
	VL_*).

	* macros/vl_check_sign.m4, macros/vl_decl_wchar_max.m4: Added.

	* src/regex.c: Memory management cleanups.  Much of the small
	memory blocks, like AST nodes, are now allocated in large blocks
	instead of one by one using the `tre_mem_t' allocator.  This got
	rid of hundreds of lines of confusing memory management code.
	
Sat Feb 16 23:47:01 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* macros/ac_prog_cc_warnings.m4: Updated to version 1.3.

	* macros/ac_decl_wchar_max.m4: Added this macro for checking
	whether WCHAR_MAX is defined, and defining it if it isn't.

	* configure.in: Added some checks for wide character stuff.

	* src/regex.c: Added `tre_' prefix to all local type names to
	avoid conflicts.
	
Mon Feb 11 21:48:03 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* src/regex.c (parse_bound, parse_re): Enabled support for
	bound expressions.  The iterated atom is duplicated by parsing it
	many times -- this seemed to be the simplest way to do it.

	* src/Makefile.am: Changed library name from `libregx' to
	`libtre'.

	* tests/retest.c: Added tests for bound expressions.
	
Sun Feb 10 18:47:23 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* src/regex.c (set_union): Bugfix, had `set1[s2].neg_classes' where
	should have been `set2[s2].neg_classes' (this caused crashes).

	* src/regex.c (ast_to_efree_tnfa): Bugfix, didn't check for
	infinite maximum iteration count before making transitions for
	them.

	* src/regex.c: Added interfaces regncomp() and regwncomp() which
	look only at the first `n' characters of the regexp pattern.  Null
	characters are allowed in the regexps when using these functions.
	
Sat Feb  9 22:39:08 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* src/regex.c: Added wide character interface: regwcomp(),
	regwexec(), and regwerror().  They work exactly like regcomp(),
	regexec() and regerror() except that the strings are
	`wchar_t *'.  Also added support for multibyte character sets.
	Fixed a lot of bugs (memory leaks, crashes) here and there.

	* tests/retest.c: Added tests for multibyte character sets and
	regcomp() error reporting.

	* tests/randtest.c: Makes random strings and tries to compile them
	with regcomp().  This can be used to find memory leaks and crashes
	in the regexp compiler.
	
Sun Jan 27 21:42:06 2002  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* src/regex.c: Added support for bracket expressions
        (e.g. "[abc]").  Multicharacter collating elements are not
	supported, neither are equivalence classes.

	* test: Renamed this directory to `tests'.

Sun Dec  2 20:20:12 2001  Ville Laurikari  <vl@iki.fi>

	* First public release.
