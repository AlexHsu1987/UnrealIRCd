Version 0.6.4
  - Fixed bug in handling iterations (like "+" and "*") inside "{m,n}"
    repeats.  This should get rid of performance problems and
    incorrect results with certain regexps involving "{m,n}" repeats.

Version 0.6.3
  - Fixed back references when REG_NOSUB is used.

  - Compilation errors and warnings fixed.  Now this should compile on
    systems that don't have wide character support, like OpenBSD, and
    works on 64 bit machines.

Version 0.6.2
  - Bug fixes.

Version 0.6.1
  - Bug fixes.

  - Some documentation updates.

Version 0.6.0
  - The doc/ directory is now actually included in source
    distributions (oops).

  - Bug fixes.

  - alloca() is no longer a requirement.  The configure script still
    looks for it, and it is used if found.

  - New approximate matching syntax.  The new syntax allows
    approximate matching to be done even using the standard regex API
    (match costs are only available when the regaexec() API is used).

  - REG_LITERAL implemented.

Version 0.5.3
  - Bug fixes and compilation fixes.

  - Best match mode (-B) for agrep.

Version 0.5.2
  - System ABI support.  TRE is now by default configured to be
    compatible with the system regex binary interface (by including
    the system regex.h and using the definitions there instead of
    TRE's own).  This can be disabled with --disable-system-abi.

  - Added a pkg-config file `tre.pc'.

  - Added support for minimal (non-greedy) repetition operators
    "*?", "+?", "??", and "{m,n}?".  They work similarly to the ones
    in Perl, except the number of characters matched is minimized
    instead of the number of repetitions.

  - Added some documentation in the doc/ subdirectory.

  - Bug fixes.

Version 0.5.1
  - Bug fixes.

Version 0.5.0
  - Approximate matching functions now fill the pmatch[] array of
    submatches if wanted.

  - Support for back referencing (not for approximate matching).

  - Changed approximate matching API to be more easily extendible in
    the future.  The match cost is now returned.

  - Bug fixes.

  - Windows project files (original versions contributed by Aymeric
    Moizard <jack@atosc.org>, thanks!).

Version 0.4.1
  - Fixed installed headers.

  - Fixed compilation problems.

Version 0.4.0
  - The name of the package changed to TRE.

  - New API for approximate regexp matching.

  - New command line utility `agrep' for approximate regexp matching
    in the style of grep.

  - New translation for Finnish (fi) has been added.

  - Optimizations in regexec.

  - Wide character support and multibyte character set support can be
    turned off with --disable-wchar and --disable-multibyte,
    respectively.

  - Lots of bugfixes.
