how to use tsp-client:

first make it "make"

then run it like this:
$ ./tsp-client <tsp server> <port>

do this a couple of times
if the answers come within 1 second count its right
then take the most common time difference count and do in UnrealIRCd like
this:

/quote tsctl offset + <difference count>

then your server is time synched

current tsp servers online:

server           port
-----------------------------
irc.flirt.org    6100


if you want to make your own TSP server (must be a box using NTP)
run ./tsp-server, it will then start running on port 6100
