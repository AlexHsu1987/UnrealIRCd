| Congratulations on your new SSL self-signed certificate for your IRCd.  |
| However, wouldn't it be better that you get your certifcate signed by   |
| some kind of Certification Authority (CA), so your users can check that |
| they are really connected to the real server, so they feel secure?      |
|                                                                         |
| An initiative has been started, to help this problem, as more and more  |
| SSL-enabled IRC servers will be started in the future, and people will  |
| have trouble authenticating that they are really at the right server.   |
| This initiative is called OpenIRC CA - They offer you to sign           |
| SSL certificates for use with your IRCd for free,                       |
| so your users can be sure that they can trust you and your server.      |     
| To get a signed certificate from them please visit the website  	  |
