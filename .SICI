| Congratulations on your new SSL self-signed certificate for your IRCd.  |
| However, wouldn't it be better that you get your certifcate signed by   |
| some kind of Certification Authority (CA), so your users can check that |
| they are really connected to the real server, so they feel secure?      |
|                                                                         |
| A initiative have been started, to help this problem, as more and more  |
| SSL-enabled IRC servers will be started in the future, and people will  |
| have trouble authenticating that they are really at the right server.   |
| This initiative is called SICI (Secure IRC Certification Initiative. We |
| sign your certificates for free, using the simple way of authenticating |
| you by going to your IRC server and testing if it's really you.         |
|                                                                         |
| You can send in your "server.req.pem" file to us at our email           |
| certs@sici.ircsystems.net, with contact info on you (IRC network, nick, |
| status). We will then contact you, and check if you have provided true  |
| information. If you need more information about SICI, visit our website |
| http://sici.ircsystems.net, where you can download our root certificate,|
| and read even more about this project.        | Press enter to continue |
