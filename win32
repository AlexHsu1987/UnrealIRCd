To do win32 compiling
- Copy include/win32/setup.h to include/
- Modify config.h to suit you 
- Make settings.h to suit you
- unzip src/win32/unrealircd.bmp.gz using your favorite program to the src/win32 dir
- From the root dir of unreal and in a command prompt (where the make file is) run 'nmake makefile.win32'

UnrealIRCd is not absolute to compile on Win32 yet

Secondly, there has been a small problem with the fact that many users have been unsuccessful in compiling the wIRCd using MSVC 6 ... the problem is that as Unreal is a GUI, the header files that come with VC6 are out of date and need updating, as the header files in use are from the original win95 release sort of time, even though the code is compatable, things have moved on in the way of controlls so to compile it you will want to download the Jan2000 Platform SDK from ftp.microsoft.com/developr/platformsdk/jan2000/ you will want to probabaly down load the whole lot, but its a wee bit big (over 500mb for the x86 version) i will be looking up which cab files you will neeed, alternitivley you can try to contact M$ and i am sure that for the price to cover p&p or the CD they will send you it all ... if you are a real diplomat you will talk them into sending it and all the other updates to you for free.  Really to compare with the *nix world, its like trying to compile something that requires a later kernel than you have, or that your glibc is xhundred years old =).

If you have any problems with that, dont understand what on earth i am going on about then do contact me on either #unrealircd on irc.ircsystems.net or you can e-mail me on this list.
