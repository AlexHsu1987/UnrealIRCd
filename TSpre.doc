Many here maybe not heard of the Story
how IRC started (and how EFnet started)
EFnet's name means "Eris-Free Network". 
Eris was a central hub at the fomer world-
wide IRC network, that anyone could just add
C:N pairs for and connect to.

I was inspired of the tought of a network
where anyone could link without application and all
that shit..

Combined with the IRCd i made (Unreal) and the tspre.org
domain i got donated by Nutcais (my IRC bro). Ive decided to 
start the TSpre IRC network, where anyone with TSpre servers
(dreamforge, IRCu p9, and their alike)

(mostly preffered is Unreal thou).. Its an experimental 
network where people can test out thier IRCds and
wIRds without having to fill out apps and so on.

There are no real rules. So just have fun :)

See http://www.tspre.org for more info on this=)
