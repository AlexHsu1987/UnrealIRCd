*** 3.1.3 Released ***

[ Unreal 3.1.4 ]
--------------------------------------------------
The fixes and backports continue. Strange how much
time maintaining Unreal can eat up...

Beta1
--------------------------------------------------

Removed tech admin.
This feature is useless bloat. If you want it back
do NOT complain to any of the Unreal coders, feel
free to reimplement it yourself. Do note, however,
that if you modify the code in any way, shape, or
form you immediately give up your ability to
receive any type of support from us.
--Luke
===================================

Line 703 in ircd.c fixed...breaks
gcc3 compatibility (thanks to shellz.net's
NuC for reporting)
--Luke
===================================

Fixed issue in s_user.c where +H opers
could be identified by normal users in
a trivial manner (thanks to Magnet from
epiknet)
--Luke
===================================

s_user.c fixes
basically, /whois doesn't display snotice
if you're +W and do it to yourself
/who the same
and "is a secure connection" is no longer
bold (it was lame)
--Luke
===================================

s_serv.c fixes
fixed map bug that allowed you to trivially
find a hidden U lined server (hopefully)
--Luke
===================================

rmed zip.c (not used at all.)
and zip.h and anything related to zip
--Luke
===================================

E lines now match glines, zlines, shuns
(if you say yes in config)
--Luke
===================================

map bug still exists (earlier fix made it
worse)...removed.
--Luke
===================================

/adchat bug that sends it to coadmins twice
(coadmins are actually server admins as far
as the ircd is concerned for most purposes, no
need to send to both UMODES)
--Luke
===================================

rewrote m_kick almost entirely (it sucked)
--Luke
===================================

newdns.c removed - another useless file
--Luke
===================================

------------------------------------------------
Beta2
------------------------------------------------

ripped cloak.c from 3.2, and added Config
options as needed.
--Luke
===================================

Fixed 3 svsnoops bugs, so it appears to be
actually working now...
--Luke
===================================

+S users no longer show channels in /whois
--Luke
===================================

Added a gzline command. I use it with bopm on
my network all the time, and am getting
sick of readding it after each new release.
Additionally, I think it's a useful command
for anyone to have.
--Luke
===================================
