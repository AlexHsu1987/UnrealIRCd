*** BUGS ***
* When a +q sets +L it sets it but displays an error msg
(??:
*** Stskeeps (cmunk@rox-56506.fyremoon.net) has joined channel #a
*** #a 951758184
*** Mode change "+q Stskeeps" on channel #a by Stskeeps
*** Mode change "-oaATcfebW" for user Stskeeps by Stskeeps
*** Channel mode +l <max> is requried for +L to be set
*** Mode change "+l 1" on channel #a by Stskeeps
*** Mode change "+L #moo" on channel #a by Stskeeps
)

*** Unreal3.0-Morrigan(fix) ***
* NOTE: If your system clock is wrong you will have problems with TOPICs
  being set on all servers. That is because TOPICs which are _new_ are 
  taken instead of old
- Fixed +f not banning when * is specified
- Fixed +q (chan owners) not being able to set +L (partially fixed)
- Fixed /tsctl segfaulting the server
- Fixed the killing bug. The cause was that when m_mode was called in the
  NICKv2 parsing routine, it sent out a :nick MODE :+x which was an unknown 
  nick, and the NICK was being sent just after, causing it to kill the user
  (was a _huge_ bastard to find)
- If someone changes their nick to irc and WebTV is enabled, problems
  occur FIX: deny change to that in m_nick (bug fixed)
- Added lost unrealircd.bmp.gz file
