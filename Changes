[ Unreal3.2 ]
- Fixed a _serious_ bug in SERVER command, reported by Valen, Forrester,
  M0rpheus, JK, and Hiten.
- Fixed /botserv problem
- Fixed permission problem with SSL .pem files (was o+r)
- Removed a redundant time.h include reported by trippin
- Modified rehash flags to use strnicmp rather than match (faster)
- Fixed some points of confusion of possible cptr->passwd bug in
  m_server_estab, reported and fixed by Kanzen_Greiver
- Fixed some more points of ->passwd bugs
- Added in devdev's INSTALL replacement
- Made it so you don't get a +W notice if you /who or /whois yourself reported by Ron885
- You can no longer specify an *@unrealircd.com/org, or unreal-*@lists.sourceforge.net email
  as your KLINE_ADDRESS (the "Why am I K:lined?" messages got too annoying)
- Removed some irc.flirt.org references.
