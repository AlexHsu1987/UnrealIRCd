Welcome to the UnrealIRCd configuration program. This program
will help you to compile your IRC server, and ask you questions
regarding the setup of it, during the process.

If you need help to set the IRCd up, mail
unreal-support@lists.sourceforge.net or ask at IRC:
/server irc.ircsystems.net, /join #unrealircd

For any sake, read Unreal.nfo and read doc/faq before asking questions

Press Escape now if you want to abort the setup, or press Enter
to continue.
