an IRC server.

=======================================================================
Unpacking the Distribution

If you are reading this, you have most likely already done this, but to 
recap:

The UnrealIRCD server comes tarred and gziped. To uncompress it and expand
it, use the following commands at the Unix prompt:

gzip -d Unreal3.0.tar.gz
tar -xvf Unreal3.0.tar

This will create a new directory called Unreal3.0 and unpack the source
into it.

=======================================================================
Editing the Configuration Files

In previous versions of the source code many files had to be edited to
make things right for any given server.

In this version you DO NOT NEED TO EDIT THE Makefile OR ANY FILES
IN include!  That is, unless you set some strange options.  If you
find the need to edit include/config.h, for example,
mail us and tell us why ; Config can be made smarter, and that will make
it so you won't have to edit anything for the next version.

=======================================================================
Compiling Your Server

Windows users: You must compile the Config program first. To do this
run the following command:  $CC src\Config.c
where $CC is the name of your compiler.  for MSVC users that is 'cl'

To build the server, simply run
	% ./Config
to start the configuraton program.  This program looks at your system
and generate the include/setup.h, include/settings.h, and Options files.
You will be asked some questions.  Usually the default answers are the best
ones and most correct.  To accept the default, just hit RETURN.

Next, type 'make'. This will compile your server. Depending on your system,
this may be a good time for a caffeine break. (MSVC users run 'nmake')

Hopefully, the server will compile without incident. If it does not, and 
you are not able to determine the error, please email
unreal-dev@lists.sourceforge.net and hopefully someone will be able to help you with the problem.  If you
do need to fix something, mail there with a patch.

BE CERTAIN TO INCLUDE OPERATING SYSTEM INFORMATION (uname -a) AND COMPILER
VERSION (gcc -v, for instance) IN ALL BUG REPORTS.


=======================================================================
Installing the Files

'make install' does not work in this release -- it doesn't do anything
except a compile if that is needed.

The only files you need are the binary from src/ircd and and an ircd.conf
(see below for copying doc/example.conf as your initial ircd.conf). You
probably will want to create a MOTD file too, as well as place the man
pages from the doc directory to appropriate place in your system.


=======================================================================
Configuring Your Server

The previous step places a file named 'example.conf' into your irc 
directory you specified to Config.

To create an IRC configuration file, edit: ircd.conf

Now edit this file to reflect your server. The file is mainly 
self-explanatory. Note that if you plan to use your server on ROXnet,
make sure that you have the following line:

U:services.roxnet.org:*:*

If you need help configuring your file, please connect to ROXnet,
(irc.flirt.org or irc.roxnet.org) - go to channel #UnrealIRCd, and ask.


=======================================================================
Starting Your Server

Simply enter the complete path to the executable into the Unix command 
line, then hit return. Your server is now operational, assuming that you 
have completed all the steps described above.

NOTE: If you get something like the following when running ircd:

ircd fd table too big
Hard Limit: 256 IRC max: 1024
Fix MAXCONNECTIONS

You need to change config.h and recompile. Find the line that says 
"#define MAXCONNECTIONS 1024", and change it to the number given after 
"Hard Limit" (most likely 256), then make the server again, following the 
above instructions.

Enjoy!
