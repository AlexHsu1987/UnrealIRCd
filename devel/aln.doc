ALN, Alphanumeric System
(C) Stskeeps 2000

ALN is a quick hack to short down usage of bandwidth-using servernames
in prefixes, NICK commands, etc etc. It replaces the name with a 
1 or 2 byte prefix in a system, look at src/aln.c for the prefix
types/values. It will be an PROTOCTL, and used in NICK messages and so on, 
and introduce a new prefix server<->server called |server. The value of the
server is calculated by a hash value, the scache system, so that the server
can lookup with a new scache function, scache_find_by_hash(int i). The
question of it will conflict in similar-hash server names, is a wonder to me
:P, we will find out, but scache will fail at same time then. 


Examples: 
& Medb 4 957458466 ~Medb bservice.org D2 0 +iwrx *
:BotService Bot - bservice.org - Owner:  terri{J}

where D2 is the hash value of oxygen.phrozen.org (/stats s on a
#define DEVELOP server). irc.flirt.org has hash 96 (ALN code AX) for
instance. 

@D2 GLOBOPS :message
will be a message from server with hash D2, found find-by-hash(256)
