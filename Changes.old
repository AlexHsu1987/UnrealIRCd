*** Unreal3.0-Morrigan(fix) ***
* NOTE: If your system clock is wrong you will have problems with TOPICs
  being set on all servers. That is because TOPICs which are _new_ are 
  taken instead of old
- Fixed +f not banning when * is specified
- Fixed +q (chan owners) not being able to set +L (partially fixed)

  nick, and the NICK was being sent just after, causing it to kill the user
  (was a _huge_ bastard to find)

  occur FIX: deny change to that in m_nick (bug fixed)
